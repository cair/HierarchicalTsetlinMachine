Tsetlin machine-based learning of AND-OR hierarchies

## Tsetlin Machines and Human-Level AI - An Eight Year Research Agenda

CAIR aims to create a new route to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) based on logical learning and scientific reasoning. This involves developing
radical methodologies and theories that revitalize decades of research in logic-based and causal inference,
including experiment design, while advancing machine learning capabilities to the DL/LLM-level and beyond.
To this end, HAI will devise a new class of inductive logic programming founded on the Tsetlin machine paradigm, and
then develop a framework for reflective reasoning that leverages the up-scaled pattern recognition capability of
Tsetlin machines. The resulting AGI methodology will profoundly change the research landscape and the impact of AI.
