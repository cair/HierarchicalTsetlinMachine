_CAIR aims to create a new route to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) based on logical learning and scientific reasoning. This involves developing
radical methodologies and theories that revitalize decades of research in logic-based and causal inference,
including experiment design, while advancing machine learning capabilities to the Deep Learning (DL)/LLM-level and beyond.
To this end, CAIR will devise a new class of inductive logic programming founded on the Tsetlin machine paradigm, and
then develop a framework for reflective reasoning that leverages the up-scaled pattern recognition capability of
Tsetlin machines. The resulting AGI methodology will profoundly change the research landscape and the impact of AI._

Although logical learning in Tsetlin Machines performs remarkably similar to multilayer neural networks and recent Tsetlin Machine advances show that they can
provide superior pattern recognition accuracy in complex tasks, the symbolic-symbolic route
to AGI crosses six unchartered research challenges (C1-C6 in the above figure):
* __C1 Conceptualization.__ We need knowledge on how logical learning of symbolic representations can repli-
cate and move beyond the inductive biases of DL/LLMs, ultimately surpassing human-level reactive thinking.
* __C2 Introspection.__ We need to understand how various aspects of human introspection, including self-
assessment, can be modeled symbolically with appropriate algorithmic and theoretical underpinnings.
* __C3 Transparency.__ We need to discover how to build the steps towards AGI so that every step can be
understood like engineers understand an airplane, enabling safety standards comparable to those in aviation.
* __C4 Lifelong learning.__ We need knowledge of the modeling, algorithms, and theory required for lifelong
symbolic-symbolic learning of knowledge, skills, and reflexes from human-like interactions with the world.
* __C5 Generalization.__ We need to uncover how to go beyond the data and build “laws-of-nature” (a scientific
world model) in a way that supports the solution to the other challenges.
* __C6 Reactive and reflective thinking.__ We need knowledge on how to integrate the reactive thinking of C1
with the reflective reasoning of C5, and how to coordinate these two modes through introspection (C2). We also
need to understand how lifelong learning (C4) can be incorporated into both reactive and reflective thinking,
for example, turning recurring reflective thinking patterns into reactive patterns for speed and automation.

The methods introduced in this repository aims to address challenge C1 above. By introucing AND-OR hierarchies, we will enable the construction of high-level concepts, moving Tsetlin Machines decisively beyond flat AND-rules.
